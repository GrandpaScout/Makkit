# Makkit

An in-world editor for Minecraft.

Makkit (pronounced Make-it) is a lightweight creative mod world
editing tool, made for Fabric on Minecraft v1.16+. It's meant to make
a lot of simple operations quicker, while being easy to use.


### Features

* In world editing, with realtime selection boxes
    * You can view each other's selections in Multiplayer, too!
* The ability to move and resize selections
* Simple transformations, like filling entire selections with 
blocks (or just the walls!)
* The ability to **copy** and **paste** selections, even along a different
axis to **rotate** them
* The ability to mirror your selections over an axis, allowing you
to easily create roofing and other symmetric structures
* A pattern tool, which lets you **tile** blocks or **repeat** them 
in a certain direction
* Edit history, letting you **undo** and **redo** at will!


#### Beta

Makkit is still in Beta, so there might be some niche bugs. I try to test
everything extensively before each release, so releases should be quite
stable. Even if something does go wrong, you can always press undo!
